General:
    - usage of only append may cause elements to be added twice.        [Reaction.py]
        -> especially bad for sets
    - isDigit might be an issue if coefficients can be doubles          [Reaction.py]
        -> stattdessen isNumeric oder isDouble? was ist schneller?
    - unclear if sets can fulfill all roles that may be required        [Reaction.py]
